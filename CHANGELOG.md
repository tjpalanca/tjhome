# Release notes

<!-- do not remove -->

## 0.1.0

### New Features

- Migrate to {nbdev} ([#6](https://github.com/tjpalanca/tjhome/issues/6))
  - We want to start developing with nbdev on to create Google Home Smart Actions. We need to migrate to {nbdev} as I've decided that's what I'm going to use from now on for all personal Python projects.
